      Bots Cry Out App

  For this project I worked on designing a data model and implementing a database that would be used to create a web application were users can login and find AI-generated prayers. My first step was to take the needed requirements and create a normalized data model using an ER diagram. To do this I used one of the recommended tools, DBDiagram. You can see my ER Diagram with the above link titled "Database-Project-Kaylee Odom.pdf". Then from there I used the "Database-Project-Kaylee Odom.sql" to implement my normalized tables into my schema in MySQL workbench. In the Table_info folder you will be able to find all the created tables in a sql file. Each table has had the needed gathered data from the BotsCryOut database inserted in.Bots Cry Out App

      Overview
  The Bots Cry Out App is a web application designed to provide users with AI-generated prayers. This repository documents the process of designing a data model, implementing a database, and creating the necessary tables for the application.

      Project Structure
- ER Diagram: The initial step involved creating a normalized data model using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. The diagram was generated using DBDiagram, and you can view it here.

- Database Implementation: The normalized tables were implemented into the MySQL Workbench schema using the SQL script provided. The script can be found in Database-Project-Kaylee Odom.sql.

- Tables Information: The Table_info folder contains individual SQL files for each table. These files include the necessary SQL queries to create the tables and insert the gathered data from the BotsCryOut database.

      Getting Started
To get started with the Bots Cry Out App, follow these steps:

- Review the ER Diagram: Take a look at the ER Diagram to understand the data model.

- Database Implementation: Execute the SQL script Database-Project-Kaylee Odom.sql in your MySQL Workbench to set up the database schema.

- Table Information: Explore the Table_info folder to understand the structure of individual tables and the data they contain.
